#Create task from portal

###Todo
* Rewrite css file so it does not includes the important.
* Include name within option project.user_id.id. This is now impossible because of a security issue. Probably because the name field is not whitelisted for use in forms.
* Find a better wat to filter on stage_id new in the form.

###Roadmap
* Make use of Odoo's widget function in JavaScript instead of jQuery.
